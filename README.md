# BakaSweeper
## MineSweeper but its the dumb version
This version of the game is written in python then compiled into an executable form.<br />
# ***This is only made for self learning purposes only!***

To play the game run BakaSweeper.exe (Don't get suprised if you see the other files named Minesweeper, because that was its original name i just changed it cuz it fits better.)<br />
### Controlls are simple:<br />
W, A, S, D to move your selection box;<br />
E to dig a hole (careful with this key, if you dig a mine you lose);<br />
Q to set a flag (since its a dumb there are no sprites, the flgas will show up as a red 'F')
##### In the top left corner you will see the mines left to win.
##### If the game ends (either you win or lose) the game stops and you have to restart the game, cuz i was lazy to do a restart cycle
